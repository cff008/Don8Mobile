Ionic App - Don8 Mobile App
=====================

This is a guide to testing the app in your browser

## Using this project

We recommend using the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) to run this project.

Make sure the `ionic` utility is installed:

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic
```

Once you've installed ionic and have the repository saved locally, move into the directory containing the project.

```bash
$ cd ~/mobile-app
```

Then, to view the application in your browser, run:

```bash
$ ionic serve -l
```

This will display the app as both iOS and Android side-by-side.



## Using Ionic View

If you don't want to install Ionic on your PC, you can also view our app through Ionic View.

Ionic View is an app for Android and iOS that allows you to view developing Ionic
projects on your mobile device.

To view our app, download Ionic View from the App Store or Play Store.

Once installed, open the app and choose "Preview App".

Enter the App ID for Don8 which is: 2ff3c64c

Once the App ID is entered, select Load App to view the app.
