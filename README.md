Ionic App - Don8 Mobile App
=====================

This is a guide to testing the app in your browser

## Using this project

We recommend using the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) to run this project.

Make sure the `ionic` utility is installed:

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic
```

Once you've installed ionic and have the repository saved locally, move into the directory containing the project.

```bash
$ cd ~/mobile-app
```

Then, to view the application in your browser, run:

```bash
$ ionic serve -l
```

This will display the app as both iOS and Android side-by-side.
